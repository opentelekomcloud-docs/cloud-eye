Introduction to Event Monitoring
================================

In event monitoring, you can query system events that are automatically reported to Cloud Eye and custom events reported to Cloud Eye through the API. You can create alarm rules for both system events and custom events. When specific events occur, Cloud Eye generates alarms for you. Event monitoring does not depend on the Agent.

Events are key operations on cloud service resources that are stored and monitored by Cloud Eye. You can view events to see operations performed by specific users on specific resources, such as deleting or rebooting an ECS.

Event monitoring is enabled by default. For details, see :ref:`Events Supported by Event Monitoring <ces_01_0054>`.

Event monitoring provides an API for reporting custom events, which helps you collect and report abnormal events or important change events generated by services to Cloud Eye.
