Using Resource Groups
=====================

Scenarios
---------

-  Resource Management

   If you use multiple cloud services, you can add all related resources, such as ECSs, BMSs, EVS disks, elastic IP addresses, bandwidths, and databases to the same resource group for easier management and O&M.

-  Routine Inspection and Quick Fault Locating

   Each resource group provides two pages: **Resource Overview** and **Alarm Rules**. This feature helps you view cloud resource usage and quickly locate faulty resources.

Functions
---------

-  Resource groups enable you to manage your cloud resources across products.
-  The **Alarm Rules** page displays all alarm rules in a resource group. You can enable, disable, modify, or delete an alarm rule.

#. Log in to the management console.

#. Click **Service List** in the upper left corner and select **Cloud Eye**.
