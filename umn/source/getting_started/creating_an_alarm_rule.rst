Creating an Alarm Rule
======================

Scenarios
---------

The alarm function provides the alarm service for monitoring data. By creating alarm rules, you define how the alarm system checks monitoring data and sends alarm notifications when metric data meets alarm policies.

After creating alarm rules for important metrics or events, you can promptly identify metric data exceptions or events and quickly rectify the faults.

Functions
---------

-  Alarm rules can be created for all monitoring items on Cloud Eye.
-  Alarm rules can be created for all resources, resource groups, log monitoring, custom monitoring, event monitoring, and website monitoring.
-  You can set validity periods of alarm rules, that is, customize the time when alarm rules take effect.
-  Notifications can be sent by email, SMS message, or HTTP/HTTPS message.

Procedure
---------

#. Log in to the management console.
#. In the upper left corner, select a region and project.
#. Click **Service List** in the upper left corner and select **Cloud Eye**.
#. Click **Service List** in the upper left corner and select **Cloud Eye**.
#. In the navigation pane, choose **Alarm Management** > **Alarm Rules**. Click **Create Alarm Rule** in the upper right corner.
#. On the **Create Alarm Rule** page, configure the parameters by referring to :ref:`Table 1 <en-us_topic_0084572213__table17694105411317>` to :ref:`Table 4 <en-us_topic_0084572213__table54161352427>`.

After the alarm rule is created, if the metric data reaches the specified threshold, Cloud Eye immediately informs you that an exception has occurred.
