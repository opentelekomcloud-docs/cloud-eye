Viewing a Graph
===============

After you add a graph, you can view the metric trends on the **Monitoring Panels** page. The system provides you both default and customizable time ranges to view trends from last month. This topic describes how to view trends for a longer time range.

Procedure
---------

#. Log in to the management console.

#. In the upper left corner, select a region and project.

#. Click **Service List** in the upper left corner, and select **Cloud Eye**.

#. Choose **Dashboard** > **Monitoring Panels**.

   You can view all monitoring graphs on the current monitoring panel.

   .. note::

      -  You can sort graphs by dragging them.
      -  You can click **1h**, **3h**, **12h**, **1d**, or **7d** in the upper part of monitoring graphs to switch the monitoring periods of all graphs on the monitoring panel. By default, raw metric data is displayed for **1h**, and the aggregated metric data is displayed for other periods.

#. Hover your mouse over a graph. In the upper right corner, click |image1| to view monitoring details on an enlarged graph. You can select a time period or customize a time range to view the metric trend in a specific monitoring interval.

   If you select **1h**, Cloud Eye displays raw data from the last hour by default; if you select any of the other time periods, Cloud Eye displays rolled-up data.
