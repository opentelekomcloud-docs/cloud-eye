Advantages
==========

Automatic Provisioning
----------------------

Cloud Eye is automatically provisioned for all users. You can use the Cloud Eye console or APIs to view cloud service statuses and set alarm rules.

Reliable Real-time Monitoring
-----------------------------

Raw data is reported to Cloud Eye in real time for monitoring of cloud services.

Alarms are generated and notifications are sent to you in real time.

Visualized Monitoring
---------------------

You can create dashboards and graphs to compare multiple metrics. The graphs are refreshed automatically to always display the latest data.

Multiple Notification Types
---------------------------

You can enable **Alarm Notification** when creating alarm rules. When a metric reaches the threshold specified in an alarm rule, Cloud Eye notifies you by sending emails, SMS messages, or HTTP/HTTPS messages. You can track the service status and establish programs accordingly to handle the alarms.

Batch Creation of Alarm Rules
-----------------------------

You can use alarm templates to create alarm rules in batches for multiple cloud services.
