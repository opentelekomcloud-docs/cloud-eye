Advantages
==========

Automatic Provisioning
----------------------

Cloud Eye is automatically provisioned for all users. You can use the Cloud Eye console or APIs to view cloud service statuses and set alarm rules.

Reliable Real-time Monitoring
-----------------------------

Raw data is reported to Cloud Eye in real time for monitoring of cloud services.

Alarms are generated and notifications are sent to you in real time.

Visualized Monitoring
---------------------

You can create dashboards and graphs to compare multiple metrics. The graphs are refreshed automatically to always display the latest data.

Multiple Notification Types
---------------------------

You can enable **Alarm Notification** when creating alarm rules. When a metric reaches the threshold specified in an alarm rule, Cloud Eye notifies you by emails or SMS messages, or by sending HTTP/HTTPS messages to an IP address of your choice, allowing you to keep track of the statuses of cloud services and enabling you to build smart alarm handling programs.

Batch Creation of Alarm Rules
-----------------------------

You can use alarm templates to create alarm rules in batches for multiple cloud services.
