Introduction to Cloud Service Monitoring
========================================

Scenarios
---------

Cloud Service Monitoring collects data of built-in metrics of cloud services. You can monitor these metrics to track the status of corresponding cloud services. On the **Cloud Service Monitoring** page, in addition to viewing monitoring data, you can also create alarm rules and export raw data.

What You Can Do with Cloud Service Monitoring
---------------------------------------------

-  Viewing metrics: You can view the graphs of raw data collected in the last 1 hour, 3 hours, 12 hours, 1 day, and 7 days. You can customize the metrics to be viewed and view monitoring data that is automatically refreshed.
-  Create alarm rules: You can create alarm rules for key metrics of cloud services. When the conditions in the alarm rule are met, Cloud Eye sends emails, SMS messages, or HTTP/HTTPS requests, enabling you to quickly respond to resource changes.
-  Exporting monitoring data: Cloud Service Monitoring allows you to export a maximum of 10 monitoring items in your selected time range and rollup period. The exported monitoring report contains the username, region name, service name, instance name, instance ID, metric name, metric data, time, and timestamp, facilitating query and filtering.
