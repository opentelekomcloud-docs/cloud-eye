What Should I Do If Agency **CESAgentAutoConfigAgency** Failed to Be Automatically Created?
===========================================================================================

When the Agent configuration is being restored, agency **CESAgentAutoConfigAgency** will be automatically created, but if you have created such an agency but not for the ECS or BMS service, agency **CESAgentAutoConfigAgency** will fail to be automatically created.

You can delete the agency you created and then restore the Agent configuration, or manually configure the agency based on :ref:`How Can I Create an Agency? <ces_faq_0028>`
