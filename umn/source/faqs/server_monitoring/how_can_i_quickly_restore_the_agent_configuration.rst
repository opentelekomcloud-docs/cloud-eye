How Can I Quickly Restore the Agent Configuration?
==================================================

After the Agent is installed, you can configure **AK/SK**, **RegionID**, and **ProjectId** in one-click mode. This saves manual configuration and improves configuration efficiency.

If you are in a region that does not support one-click configuration restoration of the Agent, on the **Server Monitoring** page, select the target ECS and click **Restore Agent Configurations**. In the displayed **Restore Agent Configurations** dialog box, click **One-Click Restore**.
