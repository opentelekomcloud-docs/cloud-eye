Does the Server Monitoring Agent Affect the Server Performance?
===============================================================

The Agent uses very minimal system resources and it has almost no impact on the server performance.

-  On a BMS,

   the Agent uses less than 5% of the CPU capacity and less than 100 MB of memory.
