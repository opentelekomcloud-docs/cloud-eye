What Is an Alarm Notification? How Many Types of Alarm Notifications Are There? How Can I Configure an Alarm Notification?
==========================================================================================================================

Alarm notifications are email or SMS messages that are sent out when an alarm status is **Alarm**, **OK**, or both.

You can configure Cloud Eye to send or not send alarm notifications when you create or modify an alarm rule.

Cloud Eye can:

-  Send you email notifications.
-  Work with Auto Scaling to trigger the system to automatically add or remove servers.
