=============================================

There are four levels of alarm severity: critical, major, minor, and informational.

-  **Critical**: An emergency fault has occurred and services are affected.
-  **Major**: A relatively serious problem has occurred and may hinder the use of resources.
-  **Minor**: A less serious problem has occurred but will not hinder the use of resources.
-  **Informational**: A potential error exists and may affect services.
