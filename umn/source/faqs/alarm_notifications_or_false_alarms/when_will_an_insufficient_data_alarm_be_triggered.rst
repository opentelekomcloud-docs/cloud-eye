When Will an "Insufficient data" Alarm Be Triggered?
====================================================

When monitoring data of a metric is not reported to Cloud Eye for three consecutive hours, the alarm rule status changes to **Insufficient data**.

In special cases, if monitoring data of a metric is reported at an interval longer than three hours and no monitoring data is reported for three consecutive intervals, the alarm rule status also changes to **Insufficient data**.
