What Are the Impacts on ECS Metrics If OTC Tools Are Not Installed on ECSs?
===========================================================================

If OTC tools are not installed on your ECSs, Cloud Eye can still monitor the outband incoming rate and outband outgoing rate. However, it cannot monitor memory usage, disk usage, inband incoming rate, or inband outgoing rate, which lowers the CPU monitoring accuracy.

To learn more about ECS metrics supported by Cloud Eye, see `Basic ECS Metrics <https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/en-us/usermanual/ecs/en-us_topic_0030911465.html>`__.
