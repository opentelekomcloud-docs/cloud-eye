Adding Subscriptions
====================

A topic is a channel used by SMN to publish messages. Therefore, after you create a topic, add subscriptions. In this way, when the metric triggers an alarm, Cloud Eye sends the alarm information to subscription endpoints of the topic.

For details about how to add a subscription, see `Adding a Subscription <https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/simple-message-notification/umn/subscription_management/adding_a_subscription.html>`__.
