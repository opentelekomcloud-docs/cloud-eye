Adding Subscriptions
====================

A topic is a channel used by SMN to publish messages. After you create a topic, add subscriptions. When the metric data reaches the specified threshold or an event occurs, Cloud Eye will send alarms to subscription endpoints of the topic.

For details about how to add a subscription, see `Adding a Subscription <https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/simple-message-notification/umn/subscription_management/adding_a_subscription.html>`__.
