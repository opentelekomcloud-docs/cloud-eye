Viewing Alarm Templates
=======================

An alarm template contains a group of alarm rules for a specific service. You can use it to quickly create alarm rules for multiple resources of a cloud service. Cloud Eye recommends alarm templates based on the attributes of each cloud service. It also allows you to create custom templates as needed.

Procedure
---------

#. Log in to the management console.
#. In the upper left corner, select a region and project.
#. Click **Service List** in the upper left corner, and select **Cloud Eye**.
#. Choose **Alarm** **Management** > **Alarm Templates**.

On the **Alarm Templates** page, you can create, view, modify, or delete custom templates.
