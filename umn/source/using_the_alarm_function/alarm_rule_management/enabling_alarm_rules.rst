Enabling Alarm Rules
====================

Scenarios
---------

If an alarm rule has been created for a resource but is currently disabled, you can enable it to keep track of the metrics or events configured in it. This allows you to promptly identify any abnormal metric data or event and quickly rectify the fault.

Procedure

You can enable an alarm rule in any of the following ways:

-  To enable multiple alarm rules, go to the **Alarm Rules** page, select multiple alarm rules, and click **Enable** in the upper left of the alarm rule list. In the displayed **Enable Alarm Rule** dialog box, click **OK**.
-  To enable a single alarm rule, go to the **Alarm Rules** page, locate the alarm rule you want to enable, and choose **More** > **Enable** in the **Operation** column. In the displayed **Enable Alarm Rule** dialog box, click **OK**.
-  On the **Alarm Rules** page, click the name of the alarm rule to be enabled. On the details page, click **Enable** in the upper right corner. In the displayed dialog box, click **OK**.
