Introduction to Alarm Rules
===========================

You can flexibly create alarm rules on the Cloud Eye console. You can create an alarm rule for a specific metric or use the alarm template to create alarm rules in batches for multiple cloud service resources.

Cloud Eye provides you with default alarm templates tailored to each service. In addition, you can also create custom alarm templates by modifying the default alarm template or by specifying every required field.
